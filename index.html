        <h2>Opinion or fact?</h2>
        <h3>Here are the facts</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
    <p>At In-N-Out, the fries aren’t just a side—they’re a love letter to the humble potato. While other chains ship in
        frozen spuds that have seen more airports than most of us, In-N-Out keeps it refreshingly old-school: whole
        potatoes, sliced in-house, fried on the spot. The result? A fry that tastes like an actual potato instead of a
        science experiment. Foodies adore that clean, honest flavor; it’s the culinary equivalent of a handshake from
        someone who means it.</p>
        Health Benefits:
        <ul>
            <li>Made from whole, real potatoes — no reconstituted mash, no mystery flakes, just actual produce you can pronounce.</li>
            <li>Cooked in 100% sunflower oil, which is naturally low in saturated fat and high in vitamin E.</li>
            <li>No preservatives, coatings, or artificial flavor enhancers, keeping the ingredient list refreshingly short and clean.</li>
            <li>Naturally lighter than typical fast-food fries, since they aren’t double-fried or heavily processed.</li>
            <li>Lower sodium by default, giving customers control over how salty they want things.</li>
            <li>Fresh-cut preparation retains more natural potato nutrients, including potassium and fiber.</li>
            <li>Gluten-free by design, since they’re just potatoes and sunflower oil.</li>
            <li>Customizable for lighter eating, thanks to options like “light well” or pairing them with mustard instead of Spread.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>And let’s talk texture. In-N-Out fries have a charm that doesn’t rely on being overly salted or aggressively
        crispy. They’re light, tender, and a little bit airy—the kind of fry that pairs perfectly with a double-double
        without stealing the spotlight. Think of them as the subtle, supportive best friend in a rom-com: always there,
        always reliable, quietly elevating the whole experience. They aren’t trying to be the loudest thing on your
        tray, just the freshest.</p>
    <br>
    <p id="yellowparagraph">Of course, part of the magic is their versatility. Craving crunch? Order them well-done and enjoy fries that snap
        like a potato chip with manners. Feeling indulgent? Animal Style transforms the fries into a glorious, melty,
        oniony, saucy masterpiece that would make any food lover weak in the knees. Prefer to keep it classic? A simple
        dunk in Spread is the kind of joy that philosophers would’ve written about if they had access to drive-thrus. No
        matter how you customize them, In-N-Out fries rise to the moment and prove why they’ve earned a devoted (and
        vocal) fan base.</p>
